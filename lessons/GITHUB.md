# Git, GitHub and Class Repository

## Report, Support and Recover ðŸ¤• (10-20 min.)

- That's right, it's standup thyme!
  - See questions at the end of this pageðŸ‘‡ !

## Git and Github Demo and Walk Through

To gitðŸ˜‰ started, we'll walk through the whole process.

- Creating a new repository
- Creating our README.md
- Setting contributor access
- Inviting contributors.
  - Hey, that's you!
- And, finally adding some basic code to get started.

So with some code in place, let's have our good friend Clive to join the team and get the repository cloned to his computer's local directory!

## Ready... Set... "ACA job Tracker App" Startup!

Now, with **your** invitation in hand...

- lets get up and running as a collaborators.

## Break(15 min.)

## Let's git push...

After adding our folder, files and filling out the 'oh, so' important **profile.js** object, let's go through adding, committing, pushing and merging our fresh code to the repository.

- We'll use the template folder to complete Clive's addition to the app and walk through the git flow of adding folders and files.

## Group Coding exercise! ðŸ‘‰ "Deal me in..."

Card games are fun, right?

- Let go through a little code challenge of how to shuffle a deck of cards and then see if we can't add some LIFE to such a silly exercise.

## Open Work

- Use this valuable time to work on a project, ask questions and focus on the areas you need to work on the most.

## Standup Questions (ðŸ•´ Stand up! ðŸ•´)

- Name ?
- Other than linkedIn, what's another resource you use when looking for jobs openings?
- What time of the day do you feel you're most productive? How long does it last?
- Done? Say, "NEXT PLEASE"
