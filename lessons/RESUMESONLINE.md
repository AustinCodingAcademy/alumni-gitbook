# Resumes and Online Presence Building

## Report, Support and Recover ðŸ¤• (10-20 min.)

- Let's start the day talking about how our job hunt/job prep is going.
  - See questions at the end of this pageðŸ‘‡ !

## Online Presence (discussion)

Let take a look at the seemly unending way you can expand your online presence and focus on what is most important.

- This may differ from individual to individual.
- However, we may find common ground on a few ways to leverage the modern **inter-webs** ðŸ˜‰!

Through our discussion we will build a resource guide.

- The resource guide will be sent out to the class when complete.
- If you missed this class or lost the link to the guide. Please reach out to your mentor or instructor.

## Checkpoint focus: Online Presence Classmate Bump

Lets take some time to be a little click farm for ourselves and review our LinkedIns for a "bump!"

Get into groups of 3-5 and review your classmates LinkedIn. Find something that you...

- Liked
- Found Interesting
- Something you learned
- Then, something you think is missing, misleading or could improve ðŸ˜¬.

Then, share your findings with the group.

## Break(15 min.)

## Checkpoint focus: Resumes

Resumes are tough, they take work and when you're trying to get your foot in the door, they can be a real pain to pull together. Lets talk about whys we can highlight our skills, what we've done and how our past experiences can play into our future endeavors.

- Skills:
  - List in order of most comfortable to least.
  - If you list it, you should be able to respond briefly to the question...
    - "Tell me a little about something you did with X?"
- Projects:
  - What the **code you wrote** did.
  - Why you did it.
  - What quantifiable measurements can you include.
- Unrelated Experience:
  - Keep it brief, but important to relate it.
- Q: More than one page?
  - A: It depends... but, ONE.

## Resume Workshop

In groups of 3-5, we will share our email addressed and email our classmates our current resume. Again, find something that you...

- Liked
- Found Interesting
- Something you learned
- Then, something you think is missing, misleading or could improve ðŸ˜¬.

## Alumni Share
