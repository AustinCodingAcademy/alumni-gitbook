# Job Search

## What are you looking for?

Since most of us are looking for our first jobs, we can consider ourselves
junior developers. The term junior in a job posting will hopefully signal a
attributes of the workplace:

* There are senior developers that are there to help
  * Some or all of the senior team as offered time to onboard someone new
* There is at least a small team
  * There must be some backup as you will start out unproductive, and may even drag down productivity of the team at first
* There is an office and the company wants to invest in you

So we should feel comfortable applying to jobs with "junior" in the name. Only
your first job should you consider yourself a junior.

The ideal first job is working in a small team with senior developers. It is not
recommended your first job be remote or building a solo projected for someone on
Craigslist.

## What can you do?

It is common to limit yourself to only what you already know (Node.js, React, .Net, etc)
but this isn't entirely necessary when applying. Languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java
are really similar and you can sometime get ramped up in a weekend or two. You can usually
interview in the language of your choice unless the they specifically ask for otherwise.

Here is a list of popular web development technologies and their equivalents.

| Language | Framework |
|-|-|-|
| C# | [ASP.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) |
| Java | [Spring MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html) |
| Ruby | [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) |
| Python | [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) |
| PHP | [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) |
| Node.js | [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)* |

All of these use the same terminology: MVC (Model-View-Controller) and all are great at building fast REST APIs.
The only barrier to entry is learning the syntax, which a quick online tutorial and a weekend should be able to knock out.
Then follow each framework's Getting Started or Tutorial page to get up and going!

Another strategy is to expand your skillset into other corners of developerment, like Quality Assurance,
Browser Automation, etc.

## Where do I find jobs?

For cold applying, Indeed is the best place to go. A good strategy is to find the
site on Indeed, then Google the company and apply directly.

## What's up with recruiters?

Recruiters are a pretty controversial topic with developers. You will be inundated
with them throughout your career. There are good ones and bad ones, but here is a good
rule of thumb:

* Internal recruiters typically work at the company they are recruiting for. These are the people you want to talk to, have lunch with, etc. Search them out for jobs you really want.

* External recruiters are hired by companies and are usually paid on some sort of commission. They do want to find the right candidate and not just place anybody, but they are somewhat incentivized to drive your price down and (understandably) don't typically care enough about the sort of environment you end up in or if it is a great personality fit. They are usually very nice and be sure to be polite back. They are people, too.

* Tips when dealing with recruiters:
  * Establish job requirements first:
    1. Want to work with an establish team
    2. Don't to be remote
    3. Don't want to move
    4. etc
  * Even though they will ask quickly and often, DO NOT give a salary expectation, or your current/past salary, etc.
    * You can say that you'll consider any offer with the right company after interviewing
      * If they are insistant I usually say "I will consider any offer over $1" or shoot really high until they get the message
    * If you have a hard lower limit, you can give a "Only reach out if salary is more than 75k", but don't be afraid to shoot high.
  * Don't worry about finding them, they will find you from LinkedIn, your website, etc.
  * Popular companies are Kforce, New Iron, [etc](https://www.builtinaustin.com/2018/10/24/23-austin-recruiting-firms-and-staffing-agencies-finding-right-fit).
  * Frustratingly, recruiters will sometimes list a job for a company on job sites, typically saying something like "Our client blah blah blah". Don't be confused.
  * They sometimes will refuse to tell you who the client is. This is to protect their commission and are usually forthcoming after talking to you a bit and what you are looking for.
  * It is considered rude to find out who the client is and apply on your own, and counter-productive since they probably could get you in sooner.
  * Can't stress this enough: try not to give anyone any more information than necessary about salary. It will be recorded, indexed, and shared. Try to never talk about past or current salary, and only what you are expecting after the company wants to make an offer.

## How many jobs do I actually apply to?

All of them. Read this article:

[I spent 3 months applying to jobs after a coding bootcamp. Hereâ€™s what I learned.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331)

The best thing to happen is to get multiple offers. DO NOT APPLY FOR ONE JOB AND WAIT TO HEAR BACK.
