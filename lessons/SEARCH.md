# Job Search

## What are you looking for?

Since most of us are looking for our first jobs, we can consider ourselves
junior developers. The term junior in a job posting will hopefully signal a
attributes of the workplace:

* There are senior developers that are there to help
  * Some or all of the senior team as offered time to onboard someone new
* There is at least a small team
  * There must be some backup as you will start out unproductive, and may even drag down productivity of the team at first
* There is an office and the company wants to invest in you

So we should feel comfortable applying to jobs with "junior" in the name. Only
your first job should you consider yourself a junior.

The ideal first job is working in a small team with senior developers. It is not
recommended your first job be remote or building a solo projected for someone on
Craigslist.

## What can you do?

It is common to limit yourself to only what you already know (Node.js, React, .Net, etc)
but this isn't entirely necessary when applying. Languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java
are really similar and you can sometime get ramped up in a weekend or two. You can usually
interview in the language of your choice unless the they specifically ask for otherwise.

Here is a list of popular web development technologies and their equivalents.

| Language | Framework |
|-|-|-|
| C# | [ASP.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) |
| Java | [Spring MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html) |
| Ruby | [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) |
| Python | [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) |
| PHP | [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) |
| Node.js | [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)* |

All of these use the same terminology: MVC (Model-View-Controller) and all are great at building fast REST APIs.
The only barrier to entry is learning the syntax, which a quick online tutorial and a weekend should be able to knock out.
Then follow each framework's Getting Started or Tutorial page to get up and going!

Another strategy is to expand your skillset into other corners of developerment, like Quality Assurance,
Browser Automation, etc.

## Where do I find jobs?

For cold applying, Indeed is the best place to go. A good strategy is to find the
site on Indeed, then Google the company and apply directly.

## What's up with recruiters?

Recruiters are a pretty controversial topic with developers. You will be inundated
with them throughout your career. There are good ones and bad ones, but here is a good
rule of thumb:

* Internal recruiters typically work at the company they are recruiting for. These are the people you want to talk to, have lunch with, etc.

* External recruiters are hired by companies and are usually paid on some sort of "backwards" commission. They do want to find the right candidate and not just place anybody, but they will drive your price down and (understandably) don't typically care enought about the sort of environment you end up in or if it is a great personality fit. They are usually very nice, but so are other professions who work on commission. Be polite back, but make sure to set up expectations first, and DO NOT give a salary expectations, or your current salary, etc. You can give a "Only reach out if salary is more than 75k" and tell them you are not interested in working remotely or moving, etc. They will find you, don't worry about seeking them out. Popular companies are Kforce, New Iron, [etc](https://www.builtinaustin.com/2018/10/24/23-austin-recruiting-firms-and-staffing-agencies-finding-right-fit). Job ads from recruiters typically say something like "Our client blah blah blah" and they sometimes will refuse to tell you who the client is. This is to protect their commission, and it is considered rude to find out who the client is and apply on your own, and counter-productive since they probably could get you in sooner.

## What if I'm unhappy at this first job?

Then I have some good news for you. [Developers are known for not buying into the
whole company loyalty thing](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/tech-companies-employee-turnover-average-tenure-silicon-valley.html).
Every 2-3 years at a company, you should re-assess if you are still learning new things and remaining engaged, if not, start looking
elsewhere, your second job and third jobs could sometimes pay up to twice your first
job, in only 4 - 6 years!

The high salaries come at a cost, you have to stay updated and relevant. You must always
be learning something new, and it can be exhausting. 10+ years doing the same thing on the
same app with the same stack, one layoff and you can find yourself struggling. It is not
meant to be stressful, just remember to always invest in yourself, and when the opportunity
to learn something new comes up at your job JUMP ON IT.
