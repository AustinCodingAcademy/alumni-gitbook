## What if I'm unhappy at this first job?

Then I have some good news for you. [Developers are known for not buying into the
whole company loyalty thing](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/tech-companies-employee-turnover-average-tenure-silicon-valley.html).
Every 2-3 years at a company, you should re-assess if you are still learning new things and remaining engaged, if not, start looking
elsewhere, your second job and third jobs could sometimes pay up to twice your first
job in only 4 - 6 years!

The high salaries come at a cost, you have to stay updated and relevant. You must always
be learning something new, and it can be exhausting. 10+ years doing the same thing on the
same app with the same stack, one layoff and you can find yourself playing catch-up. It is not
meant to be stressful, just remember to always invest in yourself, and when the opportunity
to learn something new comes up at your job JUMP ON IT.
