# Algorithms and Pair-Programming

## Report, Support and Recover ðŸ¤• (10-20 min.)

* Let's start the day talking about how our job hunt/job prep is going.
  * See questions at the end of this pageðŸ‘‡ !

## Pair-Programming

* Using the coding challenges we received from our previous class, let's get a sense of how pair-programming can help us galvanize what we've learned.
* Often, being able to work through problems in pairs or groups can really propel your knowledge as well as bringing clarity and identifying problems in a work setting.
* Pair programming is about people and if you're successful with people you're going to be a successful web developer and software engineer.
* It's also fun!

Simple website to practice and save algorithms on

## Checkpoint focus: Whiteboard Challenges

In this class we'll get to watch an Instructor/Mentor demo a whiteboard challenge before jumping in ourselves.

* FizzBuzz Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IbxzIyRMrA

## Break(15 min.)

## Alumni Share

* Student's will get a chance to share a project or exercise they worked on with the class.
* Look over the code challenges we've worked on.
  * Are there any that you like to present & pair-program with the class?
  * Reverse a string maybe?
    * Show what you did and then we can give it some fluff perhaps!!!

## Open Work

* Use this valuable time to work on a project, ask questions and focus on the areas you need to work on the most.

## Standup Questions

* Name ?
* How many jobs to you plan to apply to in July ?
* Something tech thing you'd like to learn ? (language/library/plugin/skills/etc...)
* When you daydream about an ideal job(realistic), what does it look like?
* Done? Say, "NEXT PLEASE"
