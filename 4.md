### Interview Questions

[Popular Interview Tasks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/)

* You will need to demonstrate practical mastery of the following.   -

    * Arrays and lists, binary trees, hash tables, stacks and queues, basic graph representations;  an understanding of data structure fundamentals like pointers (as if you weren't using an object oriented language).

    * Make sure you have both time and space complexity down for the data structures you end up using in your solutions â€“ become fluent in Big O Notation; knowing O(n), O(1), etc is important.

    * Also look over search through data structures  - understand how to implement iterators, understand binary search, and how hashes work, have your sorts down - merge, quick, bucket sorts, know how to traverse a graph (either BFS or DFS), and understand how to do recursions.  You will need to write these out and explain them to another person on a white board so practice this!

    * Study trie, heap, set, red-black trees, randomized quicksort, dynamic programming, heap sort, radix sort, spanning tree, minimum cuts as well.  These will definitely be useful for solving our interview questions as well.

    * Ensure you use variable names that demonstrate to the READER that you know what you are talking about (not just to you).  i.e. use 'nextPointer' vs 'abc', don't put data type (like 'string' or 'int') in the name, use names that say what it is USED FOR not what it IS.  Ask yourself: Would someone who has never spoken to you be able to understand what this variable is for?
