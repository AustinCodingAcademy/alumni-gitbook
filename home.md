# Job Placement Course

Welcome and Congratulations!

You've completed all your ACA track coursework and are weeks away from Graduation. That's a **huge** accomplishment. Take a moment and pat yourself on the back. You can feel proud about everything you've done to get here.

This four-week course is designed to help you become 100% **job ready**. Our curriculum guides you through the necessary prep work for all stages of the job search. By the end of the course, you should have everything you need to begin applying for jobs, taking interviews, and getting full-time job offers.
<!--What does it mean to be **job ready**? We've put together a Job Ready Checklist to help guide you through the process.-->

## Course Resources

Through this class, you'll have access to:
* Mentoring
* Help finding jobs
* Help preparing for interviews

The Job Placement Course has focused our efforts on what employers are looking for, and compiled a list of the most important and relevant "checkpoints" for alumni to complete.

## Course Goals

As your instructors, our goals are to help you:

## Syllabus and Timeline

The course is divided into two sections:
