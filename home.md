# Job Placement Course

After Graduation, ACA alumni still need to meet a few basic benchmarks to be Job Ready. This track will be based on a checkpoint curriculum that will make ACA alumni 100% **job ready**. In addition, there will also be mentoring, help finding jobs, help preparing for interviews, code challenge practice and other necessary prep work for landing a full-time Web Developer job.  

What does **“job ready”** mean?
* Being job ready means having a Web Developer focused resume, a finalized portfolio and two or more projects of which can be **coherently** described. In addition, being job ready means knowing what to expect throughout the interview process.
* To simplify and clarify this, the Job Placement Course has focused our efforts on what employers are looking for, and compiled a list of the most important and relevant **"check points"** for alumni to complete.
* Once **every** check point is **☑️'ed**, you will become a **certified Software Engineer with a Full-stack Web Developer focus**, ready to not only find the jobs - but **GET** the job!   

## The Check Points

* Web Developer Resume
* Portfolio Website
* Personal Domain Name Hosting
* Project 1
* Project 2
* White-boarding Algorithms
* Demo Interview
* Speed Check and Mentor meetings
* Apply to at least 25+ jobs
* Get Hired

### Web Developer Resume

Building an effective Web Developer’s resume is crucial for getting high response rates from your job applications. This process will start with a rough draft to be reviewed by a mentor. It may take several drafts before being finalized and checked off on.

### Portfolio website

A successful job applicant will have many places to point to show off their work. But, building your own personal website will not only impress employers, it will give you a chance to customize your experience and show your work in the most effective way.  

### Personal Domain Name Hosting

Once your portfolio is completed, it’s impressive to use your own domain name to host your portfolio page. The process can be relatively easy, and it really gives a professional edge to an applicant.  

### Project 1

As an ACA Alumni you should have a project already finished or finalizing. This checkpoint will make sure your project is not only done, but can be effectively “pitched”. Can you explain what you did to somebody who may not have much tech experience in 10 minuets? Also, can you explain what you did in code to somebody who does have tech experience? It’s not only crucial to finish your project, but to feel comfortable talking about it. This “pitch” will be a requirement to complete this checkpoint.

### Project 2

It’s very important to have at least two projects to point to in your resume, portfolio and various other online presences. This shows your diversity as a developer and lets you grow in your confidence and experience as well. This project will also require a “pitch” to be checked off on by a mentor.

### White-boarding Code Challenges

We will provide 15-20 common whiteboard challenges to practice. Then, in front of a mentor, a randomly selected whiteboard challenge will be presented for you completion. Once you complete two basic and one intermediate challenge, this benchmark will be checked-off on.

### Demo Interview

Meet with a mentor(s) and go through a practice interview focusing on…
1) 15-20 min phone screen going over basic “talking points” and developer questions.
2) 20-30 min. Onsite interview talking about the projects you worked on. You will also get 	a chance to try and complete one of your whiteboard challenges during this Interview.

### Speed Check and Mentor meetings

Once a month, students will be required to meet with a mentor to check progress, practice white-board challenges and work on any projects or problems that may be “blocking” a student from completing the Track. A required Initial meeting will kick off this track.

### Apply to at least 25+ jobs!

Throughout you’ll be getting constant access to job openings and interviews. You do not need to have all the checkpoints completed to start applying for jobs.

### Get Hired!

How are the checkpoints completed?

In order for a checkpoint to be “checked off”, a mentor will need to review and sign off on the completion of the checkpoint. Some check points may include various in-person elements with a mentor or other observer.

What happens after all the checkpoints are checked off, except for the last one… “Getting a Job”?

The teachers, mentors and staff at the ACA will not leave your side until you’ve landed a job. As long as you’re putting in the work assigned, a position as a Web Developer is inevitable.


By the end of the next 4 weeks, you will have the skills to place yourself in a job.
