## Break(15 min.)

### Final Project: Bowling. 
Basic rules of bowling
* Each player is given Ten Frames 
* Each Frame has two bowls
* Each Frame starts with 10 pins.
* After the first bowl, **only** the pins you didn't knock over shall remain for your second bowl
  * For example: If you knock over 7 pins on your first bowl. Only 3 remain to knock over on your second.

SCORING: Simply put, you score a point per pin you knock over.  
* However, here are so way you can gain more points.
  * A SPARE: Knock over all the pins remaining with your **second** bowl. 
    * This frame's score of ten, now gets to add the next bowl.
  * A STRIKE: Knocking over all the pins on your first bowl. 
    * This frame's score of ten, now gets to add the next **TWO** bowls.
  * If either a STRIKE or SPARE is awarded on the 10th frame. 
    * Take an additional 
      * Bowl for a Spare or 
      * TWO bowls for a Strike 
        * If a strike is scored on the first extra bowl, you get a full 10 pin set for the 2nd bowl.
    * Add those points to your 10th frame. 

Example: [7,2,5,5,4,2,10,10,8]
* How is it scored?
