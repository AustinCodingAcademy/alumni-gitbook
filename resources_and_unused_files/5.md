# Day 5 - Strategies for How to Find and Apply for Jobs

Use job search resources to identify open positions. Apply on the job search site and then apply on the comapny's website. Spend time on the cover letter. Make sure your resume is updated, clean, and represents your strength. Make sure your online presence is pristine. Include a link to your github which should have a "green square" for every day. Apply to hundreds of jobs. Don't be intimated by job descriptions listing requirements that you don't have.
