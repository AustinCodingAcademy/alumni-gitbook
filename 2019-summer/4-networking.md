  * Who was there? Who did you meet and talk to?
  * What did you enjoy / find useful about the event?
  * What could be improved about the event?
  * If this event was held again, would you return?
* Where do you go to find out about tech-related events in Austin?
* Are there any Meetup groups or community organizations that have been helpful to your job search?

## Homework

* Research networking events. See the resource list above for ideas!
* **Create a list of 5 Meetups or regularly-occurring networking events that you're interested in attending.**
  * Choose events that are tailored to your interested. The more specific, the better!
  * Join the event's Meetup page, Facebook group, etc.
  * Sign up for the group/event's email newsletter.
* **Choose one upcoming event that you plan to attend.** It can be one of the Meetups/events on your list, or a different event that's not on your list.
  * Set a concrete game plan / goal for the event.
    * Examples: Speak to a representative from 3 companies you're interested in, talk to at least 1 person about your favorite coding project, etc.
* To turn in this homework assignment, email your list and chosen event to Dana.
