## Attending a networking event

So you've registered to attend a networking event - awesome! But what comes next?

Here are some tips to prepare for a successful networking experience:

### Set a goal

Networking events can feel much less daunting when you have a goal in mind. The night before, establish a **concrete, measurable goal** for the event. Examples:

* Talk to 6 company recruiters about open roles. Give each of them a copy of your resume.
* Introduce yourself to 4 new people and practice telling them about your favorite coding project.
* Seek out 3 engineers from Google and talk to them about what they're working on. Exchange LinkedIn profiles.
* Make a list of 5 companies you're interested in. Talk with one person from each of those companies and exchange contact information.

### What to wear

* Business casual
  * Women:
    * Slacks/skirt or nice jeans paired with a blouse or button-down shirt
    * An office-appropriate dress
    * Fun jewelry (keep it professional though)
    * Comfy shoes
  * Men:
    * Slacks or nice jeans and a button-down shirt
* Comfort is key - networking events are often crowded and involve lots of standing/walking around

### What to bring

* Copies of your resume (especially if it's a recruiting-focused event like a job fair)
* Business cards
  * If you don't have business cards, connect digitally instead! Download the LinkedIn app to your phone. If you meet someone interesting, ask to connect with them on LinkedIn and add them to your network on the spot.
* Backpack / shoulder bag
  * To hold stuff you collect at the event (business cards, company literature, brochures, swag, etc.)
* Your laptop
  * But only if you're actually planning to demo something. Networking events are often crowded and it may be inconvenient to lug around.
* A friend - networking events are much more fun when you know someone else there
  * Challenge your friend to see who can meet their networking goal the quickest
  * Grab a drink/snack afterwards and debrief
  
### During the event

* **Embrace the awkwardness.**
  * It's normal to feel awkward at events like these. Take breaks between conversations with new people. Link up with your networking buddy and debrief for 5 minutes. Or step outside or take a trip to the restroom if you need a breather.
* **Excuse me, may I join you?**
  * Politely asking to join a conversation is an expected practice at networking events. Everyone is there to meet others, so they will likely welcome the chance to talk to someone new.
* **Expect 5 minutes or less with recruiters.**
  * Recruiters are often in high demand at networking events. There might even be a line in front of their booth to talk to them! Have your career story and questions prepared ahead of time, so you can cut to the chase when you're face-to-face.
* **It's been great talking to you...**
  * Don't feel trapped in a conversation. It's normal to politely excuse yourself if you need to get moving on those networking goals! Politely thank the person or group for their time, exchange contact info (if you'd like), and move on.
* **Ask questions.**
  * Whether you're talking to a recruiter or a fellow techie, asking questions is a surefire way to get to know them. Need ideas?

* **Get their contact info.**
  * If your conversation with someone is going well, remember to ask for their contact info so you can get in touch later!
* **Smile!**
  * A friendly smile goes a long way. ðŸ˜ƒ

### After the event

* Follow up! Send a brief email or LinkedIn message to everyone you had a conversation with, **especially** recruiters.
  * If it's someone you'd like to keep in touch with, include a **call to action** in your message.
    * For recruiters, ask for a phone call to learn more about their open roles. That shows you're interested and want to keep the conversation going.
    * For others, suggest meeting for coffee/lunch or attending a future networking event together.
  * Make it personal: Thank them for their time and include details you enjoyed about the conversation.
