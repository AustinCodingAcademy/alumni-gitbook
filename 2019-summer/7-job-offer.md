# Post-Interview: Job Offers & Negotiation

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have one minute to answer the following prompt:

* Describe a professional situation when you went above and beyond what was expected of you. (This does **not** need to be coding-related)
  * Use the STAR method to tell the story!
    * S - Situation (set the scene)
    * T - Task (describe what was required, when, where, who was involved)
    * A - Action (what you did, skills used)
    * R - Result (what happened?)
    
## Job Offers

Here are a few notes on job offers (adapted from [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)):

* **Offer deadlines and extensions:** When companies extend an offer, there's almost always a deadline attached to it. Usually these deadlines are 1-4 weeks out. If you're still waiting to hear back from other companies, you can ask for an extension.

* **Declining an offer:** Even if you aren't interested in working for this company right now, you might be interested in working for it in a few years. It's in your best interest to decline the offer on good terms and keep a line of communication open.

* **Handling rejection:** Getting rejected in unfortunate, but it doesn't mean that you're not a great engineer. Companies understand that these interviews aren't perfect and many good engineers get rejected. For this reason, companies are often eager to re-interview previously rejected candidates. If you receive a rejection, use this as an opportunity to build a bridge to re-apply. Thank your recruiter for their time, explain that you're disappointed but that you understand their position, and ask when you can re-applly to the company.

* **Evaluating the job offer:** Here are a few factors you should consider when evaluating your job offer.
  * Financial compensation package - salary, signing bonus, relocation budget, annual bonus, stock options/grants, etc.
  * Career development - company reputation, path to promotion, learning and mentorship opportunities, etc.
  * Company stability - startup vs. established company, how much risk are you personally willing to take on?
  * Happiness factor - products/projects you'll be working on, manager and teammates, company culture, work/life balance
  
* **Ask questions:** After receiving your job offer, gather as much info as you can about your potential new role. Here are some questions you can ask the recruiter or hiring manager:
  * Can I shadow someone in this role for a day?
  * How would I be on-boarded to the company?
  * What does success look like in this position, for a year?
  * Can you give me an example of someone on this team who was recently promoted?
  * Can you tell me how you determined my salary?
  * When would I be eligible for a raise and/or promotion?
  * What is the average bonus for someone at my level?

## Salary Negotiation

### Step 1: Do your research

Prepare for the salary negotation conversation by doing research **before** you speak with anyone from the company.

Here are some questions you should aim to answer before beginning the negotiation:
* What's an appropriate salary range for this role among employers in your area?
* What does the company typically pay employees in this role (or similar roles)?
* What is the cost of living in your area?

Online salary resources:

* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) - company reviews and salary calculator
* [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/)
* [LinkedIn salary calculator](https://www.linkedin.com/salary/)
* [Indeed salary comparison](https://www.indeed.com/salaries)
* [Monster.com salary calculator](https://www.monster.com/salary/)
* [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/)

Leverage your connections! Here's who you can ask about salary values and ranges:

* Other ACA grads
* ACA staff and instructors
* Your college alumni network (they may be able to connect you with alumni at a specific company)
* LinkedIn (find friends of friends at a specific company)
* Contacts in the local tech community

### Step 2: Pick your numbers

Armed with your research, determine the salary range you're comfortable with for this role. Do this **before** you enter the negotiation.

Set three salary levels that will serve as the framework for your negotiation:
* High - "the highest number you can say with a straight face"
* Middle - the number you think is right, based on your research
* Low - the lowest you can go, based on your current expenses

Compensation is not just salary. Here are other forms of compensation to consider in your negotiation:
* Vacation / paid time off
* Flexibility - remote / work from home
* Annual bonus
* Education/conference budget
* Deferred start date
* Moving costs
* Stock options
* Title change ("Senior Engineer" vs. "Engineer")
* Transportation/travel budget (parking spot, bus pass, etc.)
* Retirement benefits
* Accelerated timeline for promotion

### Step 3: Negotiate!

Here's one approach to beginning a salary negotiation:
You be the first to propose a number. Start with your high number and go from there. You may be pleasantly surprised!

Regardless of your starting approach, be sure to talk about your accomplishments to underscore how much value you're bringing to the company. This is where your storytelling skills come into play.

Make a list of "wins" you can talk about during the negotiation. Here are some ideas:
* Projects and achievements you're proud of
* Obstacles and challenges you overcame
* Situations when you went above and beyond (if possible, compare to the original job description)
* Situations where you took initiative

For each item on your list, use the **STAR method** to tell the story:
* S - Situation (set the scene)
* T - Task (describe what was required, when, where, who was involved)
* A - Action (what you did, skills used)
* R - Result (what happened?)

You can also cite skills and competencies that you bring to the table:
* Interpersonal skills
* Leadership
* Detail-oriented
* Technical expertise (specific programming languages or technologies)
* Enthusiasm, positive attitude
* Team-building skills
* Professional network
* Certifications
* Awards

## Homework (optional)

Make a list of three professional "wins" that you can talk about during job interviews and salary negotiation. (These do not need to be coding-related.)

Here are some ideas:
* Projects and achievements you're proud of
* Obstacles and challenges you overcame
* Situations when you went above and beyond what was expected
* Situations where you took initiative

For each win on your list, practice using the STAR method to craft a compelling story.
* S - Situation (set the scene)
* T - Task (describe what was required, when, where, who was involved)
* A - Action (what you did, skills used)
* R - Result (what happened?)
