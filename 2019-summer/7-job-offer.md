# Post-Interview: Job Offers & Negotiation

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have one minute to answer the following prompt:

* Describe a professional situation when you went above and beyond what was expected of you. (This does **not** need to be coding-related)
  * Use the STAR method to tell the story!
    * S - Situation (set the scene)
    * T - Task (describe what was required, when, where, who was involved)
    * A - Action (what you did, skills used)
    * R - Result (what happened?)

## Negotiation

### Step 1: Do your research

Prepare for the salary negotation conversation by doing research **before** you speak with anyone from the company.

Here are some questions you should aim to answer before beginning the negotiation:
* What's an appropriate salary range for this role among employers in your area?
* What does the company typically pay employees in this role (or similar roles)?
* What is the cost of living in your area?

Online salary resources:

* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) - company reviews and salary calculator
* [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/)
* [LinkedIn salary calculator](https://www.linkedin.com/salary/)
* [Indeed salary comparison](https://www.indeed.com/salaries)
* [Monster.com salary calculator](https://www.monster.com/salary/)
* [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/)

Leverage your connections! Here's who you can ask about salary values and ranges:

* Other ACA grads
* Your college alumni network (they may be able to connect you with alumni at a specific company)
* LinkedIn (find friends of friends at a specific company)
* Contacts in the local tech community

### Step 2: Pick your numbers

Armed with your research, determine the salary range you're comfortable with for this role. Do this **before** you enter the negotiation.

Set three salary levels that will serve as the framework for your negotiation:
* High - "the highest number you can say with a straight face"
* Middle - the number you think is right, based on your research
* Low - the lowest you can go, based on your current expenses

Compensation is not just salary. Here are other forms of compensation to consider in your negotiation:
* Vacation / paid time off
* Flexibility - remote / work from home
* Education/conference budget
* Deferred start date
* Moving costs
* Stock options
* Title change ("Senior Engineer" vs. "Engineer")
* Transportation/travel budget (parking spot, bus pass, etc.)
* Retirement benefits
* Accelerated timeline for promotion

### Step 3: Negotiate!

Here's one approach to beginning a salary negotiation:
You be the first to propose a number. Start with your high number and go from there. You may be pleasantly surprised!

Regardless of your starting approach, be sure to talk about your accomplishments to underscore how much value you're bringing to the company. This is where your storytelling skills come into play.

Make a list of "wins" you can talk about during the negotiation. Here are some ideas:
* Projects and achievements you're proud of
* Obstacles and challenges you overcame
* Situations when you went above and beyond (if possible, compare to the original job description)
* Situations where you took initiative

For each item on your list, use the **STAR method** to tell the story:
* S - Situation (set the scene)
* T - Task (describe what was required, when, where, who was involved)
* A - Action (what you did, skills used)
* R - Result (what happened?)

You can also cite skills and competencies that you bring to the table:
* Interpersonal skills
* Leadership
* Detail-oriented
* Technical expertise (specific programming languages or technologies)
* Enthusiasm, positive attitude
* Team-building skills
* Professional network
* Certifications
* Awards
