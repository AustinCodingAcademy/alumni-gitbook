# Post-Interview: Job Offers & Negotiation

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have one minute to answer the following prompt:

## Negotiation

### Step 1: Do your research

Prepare for the salary negotation conversation by doing research **before** you speak with anyone from the company.

Here are some questions you should aim to answer before beginning the negotiation:
* What's an appropriate salary range for this role among employers in your area?
* What does the company typically pay employees in this role (or similar roles)?
