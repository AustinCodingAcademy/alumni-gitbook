# Developing Your Personal Brand

## Your personal brand

What unique qualities do you bring to the table?

Your personal brand encompasses:
* Online accounts & presence
* Your work:
  * Previous job/internship experience
  * Coding projects (your portfolio of class assignments, hobby projects, etc.)
  * Tech-related volunteer/community experience
* Your career story
  * Why coding?
  * Your coding journey - how did you get to where you are now?
  * What do you want to do in your career as a developer?
* Personality & all the qualities that make you unique

## Storytelling

Let's talk about ourselves!

Talking about yourself can often feel awkward or uncomfortable. Yet "pitching" yourself and our work is an essential part of the job search. Throughout the interview process, you'll be asked about topics like career goals, favorite programming languages, projects you've completed, and so much more. These questions present opportunities to tell a compelling story, connect with your interviewers, and set yourself apart from the crowd.

While it's important to prepare for coding questions and whiteboarding, the stories we tell about ourselves and our projects are an equally important part of the technical interview process.

### STAR method

The **STAR method** is a handy way to structure stories that are compelling and memorable:

* S - Situation (set the scene)
* T - Task (describe what was required, when, where, who was involved)
* A - Action (what you did, skills used)
* R - Result (what happened?)

### Career story

On your own, jot down answers to the following questions:
* What inspired you to learn how to code?
* Tell me about your coding journey. How did you get to where you are now?
* What do you want to do in your career as a developer?

In pairs, practice interviewing each other.

### Project stories

Pick one of your favorite coding projects. Write down answers to the following questions:
* What does this project do?
* Did you work on this project alone or with a team? If you worked with a team, what did you contribute?
* Whatâ€™s your favorite feature of this project?
* How is this feature implemented/designed? (brief, high-level, technical summary)
* Describe a challenging moment you encountered while working on this project.
* How did you respond to this challenging moment?
* If you could add one feature OR make one improvement to this project, what would it be?
* What's one fun fact or random/quirky aspect of this project?
  
In pairs, practice interviewing each other about your projects. Try to avoid referring to your notes as much as possible!

Before real-world interviews, you should have at least 2 project stories prepared.

### Developer stories

Tell me about a time you...
* ...encountered a particularly nasty bug in your code. What did you do? How did you solve it?
* ...felt especially proud about code you wrote. What we were you working on?
* ...had a disagreement with a (coding) teammate. What happened? How did you resolve it?
* ...took a leadership role on a coding team or group project. How did you move the project forward?

## Class discussion

**Today's topic:** Building confidence for the job search

* What makes you feel confident?
* How do you stay motivated, even when things become difficult?
* As a class, what practices can we put into place to bolster confidence and motivation?

## Homework

Complete a first draft of your profile for the [ACA graduate profile page](https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/).

* Step 1 - Fill out the profile template:
  * On your local machine, create a new file `firstname-lastname.md`.
  * In the file, copy and paste this [profile template content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danawen/grad-class-sep-2019/master/profiles/template.md).
  * Fill out the template as much as you can. **Don't worry if you can't complete all the fields yet!** Once your profile is hosted on the staging area, you'll be able to edit it as needed.
  * When your profile is ready to submit, email the file to dana@austincodingacademy.com and I'll add it to the staging area!
  * I'll have the staging area set up by next Tuesday and will provide instructions then on how you can edit your profile.
  * After graduation, we'll move all the profiles from the staging area to the [public grad profile page](https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/).
  
* Step 2 - Create a Gravatar (automatic profile photo):
  * On the [Gravatar home page](https://en.gravatar.com/), click the blue button "Create Your Own Gravatar".
  * When signing up, use the same email address you included in your profile. (This is important!)
  * Upload a profile photo and you're all set! We'll use your email address to automatically find your Gravatar photo and set it as your profile headshot.
