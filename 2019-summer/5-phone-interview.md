# Phone Interviews

## Phone interview practice

### Non-technical phone interviews

Non-technical phone interviews are typically conducted by a recruiter, HR representative, or hiring manager. You'll usually complete 1-2 non-technical phone interviews before moving on to coding/technical interviews. The objective of the non-technical phone interview is to learn a little about your personality and accomplishments to see if you're a good fit for the role.

Non-technical phone interviews are usually 30 minutes long. You'll probably complete 1-4 technical phone interviews before you're invited for onsite interviews. (Be sure to ask your recruiter or primary contact about the company's exact process, so you know what to expect.)

Common questions:

* Why are you applying for this role?
  * Even though you likely applied for the $$$, you must be prepared to give a better reason!
    * I use X product made by the company
    * I'm interested in the company's industry
    * I've read the company blog
    * The company has a reputation as a great place to work
* What makes you a good fit for this role?
* Why do you want to work here?
* What can you tell me about yourself?
* What's your ideal job?
* What motivates you?
* What makes a good team player?
* Can you list your strengths?
* What weaknesses do you have?
* Why should I consider hiring you?
* Where do you see yourself five years from now?
* What is your salary expectation?
  * Don't feel pressured to answer this! Politely defer talking about compensation until later in the interview process.
* Is there anything that you would like to ask me?
  * Be sure to have some questions ready to ask your interviewer!
    * "How long have you worked there?"
    * "What do you like most about it?"
    * "If there was one thing you could change about working there, what would it be?"
    * "What are the company's goals/vision?"

### Coding/technical phone interviews

After your non-technical phone interviews, the recruiting/HR team will send you on to a round of the technical phone interviews. These are typically conducted by folks from engineering - a developer, engineering manager, or someone else with technical knowledge. They will likely be a potential teammate or someone who works closely with the team you're interviewing for.

Often, you'll need a laptop or computer handy for your technical phone interview. For the coding portion, the interviewer may ask you to share your screen or type your code into a shared website (like [Collabedit](http://collabedit.com/)). As with any coding interview, be prepared to explain your thought process as you're coming up with a solution and writing code.

Technical phone interviews are usually 30 or 45 minutes long.

Sample 30-min technical phone interview flow:
* Intros (5 min)
* Coding question (15-20 min)
* Questions & wrap-up (5-10 min)

## Other types of remote interviews

Here are some other types of preliminary interviews you may encounter during the process:
* Programming / technical knowledge test
* Coding challenge (find the bugs in a section of code, implement a small feature, etc.)
* Behavioral / personality test
