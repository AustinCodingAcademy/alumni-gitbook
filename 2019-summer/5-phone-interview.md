# Phone Interviews

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have **one minute** to answer the following prompt:

* Name a website that you find particularly well-designed.
  * What makes this website well-designed? Describe 1-2 features that make it easy and fun to use.

## Interview demo

Special guests Edsel and Charles will demo a technical phone interview! You'll have a chance to ask them questions afterwards.

## Phone interview practice

### Non-technical phone interviews

Non-technical phone interviews are typically conducted by a recruiter, HR representative, or hiring manager. You'll usually complete 1-2 non-technical phone interviews before moving on to coding/technical interviews. The objective of the non-technical phone interview is to learn a little about your personality and accomplishments to see if you're a good fit for the role.

Non-technical phone interviews are usually 30 minutes long. You'll probably complete 1-4 technical phone interviews before you're invited for onsite interviews. (Be sure to ask your recruiter or primary contact about the company's exact process, so you know what to expect.)

Common questions:

* What can you tell me about yourself?
* Can you list your strengths?
* What weaknesses do you have?
* Why should I consider hiring you?
* Where do you see yourself five years from now?
* Why do you want to work here?
* What is your salary expectation?
* What motivates you?
* What makes a good team player?
* Is there anything that you would like to ask me?

### Coding/technical phone interviews

After your non-technical phone interviews, the recruiting/HR team will send you on to a round of the technical phone interviews. These are typically conducted by folks from engineering - a developer, engineering manager, or someone else with technical knowledge. They will likely be a potential teammate or someone who works closely with the team you're interviewing for.

Often, you'll need a laptop or computer handy for your technical phone interview. For the coding portion, the interviewer may ask you to share your screen or type your code into a shared website (like [Collabedit](http://collabedit.com/)). As with any coding interview, be prepared to explain your thought process as you're coming up with a solution and writing code.

Technical phone interviews are usually 30 or 45 minutes long.

Sample 30-min technical phone interview flow:
* Intros (5 min)
* Coding question (15-20 min)
* Questions & wrap-up (5-10 min)
