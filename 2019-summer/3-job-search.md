# The Job Search
  
## Getting started

Food for thought:
[I spent 3 months applying to jobs after a coding bootcamp. Here’s what I learned.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331/)

5 main takeaways from the author's job search:
* Get through to real people
* Start small and work your way up
* Study like your future job depends on it
* Put your best foot forward
* It’s a marathon, not a sprint
  
## What to look for

What's your ideal tech role? Here are some characteristics to consider:

* Type of role / job title
* Industry
* Company (size, startup vs. established, reputation/reviews, etc.)

## What's up with recruiters?

Types of recruiters you may encounter during your job search:

**Internal recruiters** typically work at the company they are recruiting for. These are the people you want to talk to, have lunch with, etc. Search them out for jobs you really want.

**External recruiters** ("headhunters") are hired by companies and are usually paid on some sort of commission. They do want to find the right candidate and not just place anybody, but they are somewhat incentivized to drive your salary down (due to the commission system). They may not be as focused on the sort of environment you end up in, or if it is a great personality fit.

Tips when dealing with recruiters:

* Establish job requirements first:
  * Looking for a full-time position
  * Want to work with an established team
  * Don't to work remotely
  * Don't want to move to another city
  * Etc.
* Even though they will ask quickly and often, DO NOT give a salary expectation, or your current/past salary, etc.
  * You can say that you'll consider any offer with the right company after interviewing
    * If they are insistent, I usually say "I will consider any offer over $1" or shoot really high until they get the message
  * If you have a hard lower limit, you can say "Only reach out if salary is more than 65k", but don't be afraid to shoot high.
* Don't worry about finding them. They will find you from LinkedIn, your website, etc.
* Popular recruiting companies are Kforce, New Iron, etc.

-->
* Frustratingly, recruiters will sometimes list a job for a company on job sites, typically saying something like "Our client blah blah blah". Don't be confused.
* External recruiters will sometimes refuse to tell you who their client is. This is to protect their commission and are usually forthcoming after talking to you a bit and what you are looking for.
* It is considered rude to find out who an external recruiter's client is and apply on your own. It's also counter-productive since they probably could get you in sooner.
* Even if a recruiter acts in a pushy manner towards you, remain polite and friendly. You're both members of the same tech community. Who knows, maybe you'll need their help sometime in the future.
* Can't stress this enough: **Avoid giving anyone any more information than necessary about salary.** It will be recorded, indexed, and shared. Avoid talking about past or current salary to potential employers. If you do, only share what you are expecting **after** the company wants to make an offer.

## Reaching out to employers

Establishing a personal connection with a potential employer is **critical**! It dramatically increases the chance that your resume or job application will be seen and will make it to the next stage of the process.

Whenever you submit a job application, or even if you just find a job posting that sounds interesting, make a point of emailing someone at the company to introduce yourself and express your interest. Remember to include a call to action in your email, like asking for a phone call with a specific person/role. 

Here is an example you can use as a template:

> Hello,
> 
> I'm interested in the open position for a Front End Developer at Cool Software Enterprises. I've submitted my application through your online portal, and I'm eager to learn more about the role. Would it be possible to schedule a brief phone conversation with one of your hiring managers?
> 
> A little about me: I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer and recent graduate of Austin Coding Academy. My technology stack includes JavaScript, C#, Angular and HTML/CSS, but I've also worked with .NET.
> For details about my portfolio and work experience, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/).
> 
> Thanks much for your time. I look forward to speaking with one of your hiring managers soon.
> 
> Best,<br/>
> Your Name Here

## Homework
<!--
  * Prepare for the class field trip to WeConnect's Austin Tech Networking Mixer:
    * Research employers who will be attending, including any open roles you're interested in.
    * Refine and practice your [dream job story](https://alumni.austincodingacademy.com/_book/2019-summer/3-job-search.html#question-of-the-day), your [career story](https://alumni.austincodingacademy.com/_book/2019-summer/2-personal-brand.html#career-story) , and your [project stories](https://alumni.austincodingacademy.com/_book/2019-summer/2-personal-brand.html#project-stories) until you feel confident about sharing with anyone you meet, including recruiters.
    * Print copies of your resume
    * Prepare business cards or download the LinkedIn app to your phone
-->

  * Research companies that hire folks in your desired role(s).
  * **Create a list of 5 companies you'd like to apply to.**
    * Focus on companies with openings for your desired role(s) (or similar roles).
  * **For each company,** gather the following info:
    * Name of a person at that company that can help you start the application process (recruiter, HR representative, someone you know, etc.)
    * Contact info for that person (email, phone number, LinkedIn profile, etc.)
    * Your plan of action! **When** and **how** will you start a conversation with that person to learn more? (1-3 sentences)
