# The Job Search

  * Type of role
  * Industry
  * Product - what do you want to build?
  * Technologies - programming languages, frameworks, etc.
  * Company - size, startup vs. established, etc.
  * Team culture - size, structure, development/release cycle, "pager duty", etc.

## What's up with recruiters?

Types of recruiters you may encounter during your job search:

**Internal recruiters** typically work at the company they are recruiting for. These are the people you want to talk to, have lunch with, etc. Search them out for jobs you really want.

**External recruiters** ("headhunters") are hired by companies and are usually paid on some sort of commission. They do want to find the right candidate and not just place anybody, but they are somewhat incentivized to drive your salary down (due to the commission system). They may not be as focused on the sort of environment you end up in, or if it is a great personality fit.

Tips when dealing with recruiters:

* Establish job requirements first:
  * Looking for a full-time position
  * Want to work with an established team
  * Don't to work remotely
  * Don't want to move away from Austin
  * Etc.
* Even though they will ask quickly and often, DO NOT give a salary expectation, or your current/past salary, etc.
  * You can say that you'll consider any offer with the right company after interviewing
    * If they are insistent, I usually say "I will consider any offer over $1" or shoot really high until they get the message
  * If you have a hard lower limit, you can say "Only reach out if salary is more than 75k", but don't be afraid to shoot high.
* Don't worry about finding them. They will find you from LinkedIn, your website, etc.
* Popular recruiting companies are Kforce, New Iron, etc.
* Frustratingly, recruiters will sometimes list a job for a company on job sites, typically saying something like "Our client blah blah blah". Don't be confused.
* External recruiters will sometimes refuse to tell you who their client is. This is to protect their commission and are usually forthcoming after talking to you a bit and what you are looking for.
* It is considered rude to find out who an external recruiter's client is and apply on your own. It's also counter-productive since they probably could get you in sooner.
* Even if a recruiter acts in a pushy manner towards you, remain polite and friendly. You're both members of the same tech community. Who knows, maybe you'll need their help sometime in the future.
* Can't stress this enough: **Avoid giving anyone any more information than necessary about salary.** It will be recorded, indexed, and shared. Avoid talking about past or current salary to potential employers. If you do, only share what you are expecting **after** the company wants to make an offer.

## Applying to jobs

## Reaching out to employers

## Class discussion

**Today's Topic:** Job search resources & sharing

* Where do you go to look for jobs?
  * Share specific websites, job fairs, resources that have been helpful
* Where are you in your job search?
* What are some difficulties or obstacles that you're facing in your search?

## Homework

* Research companies in Austin that hire folks in your desired role(s).
* **Create a list of 5 companies you'd like to apply to.**
  * Focus on companies with openings for your desired role(s) (or similar roles).
* **For each company,** gather the following info:
  * Name of a person at that company that can help you start the application process (recruiter, HR representative, someone you know, etc.)
  * Contact info for that person (email, phone number, LinkedIn profile, etc.)
  * Your plan of action! **When** and **how** will you start a conversation with that person to learn more? (1-3 sentences)
* To turn in this homework assignment, email your list and company info to Dana.
