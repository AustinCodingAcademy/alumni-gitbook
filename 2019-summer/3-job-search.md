# The Job Search

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have **one minute** to answer the following prompt:

### Your dream job

* What's your dream tech job?
* Your answer could incorporate any of these characteristics:
  * Type of role
  * Industry
  * Product
  * Company (size, startup vs. established, etc.)
  * Team culture (size, development/release cycle, "pager duty", etc.)
  * Company culture (diversity, benefits, flexible schedule, etc.)
  * Anything else you can think of

## Class discussion

## Homework

* Research companies in Austin that hire folks in your desired role(s).
* **Create a list of 5 companies you'd like to apply to.**
  * Focus on companies with openings for your desired role(s) (or similar roles).
* **For each company,** gather the following info:
  * Name of a person at that company that can help you start the application process (recruiter, HR representative, someone you know, etc.)
  * Contact info for that person (email, phone number, LinkedIn profile, etc.)
  * Your plan of action! **When** and **how** will you start a conversation with that person to learn more? (1-3 sentences)
* To turn in this homework assignment, email your list and company info to Dana.
