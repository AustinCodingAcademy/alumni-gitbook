# The Interview Process

## Stages of the interview

### Scheduling

After submitting a job application, you'll typically recieve either a phone call or email from
someone internally setting up a call with someone to begin the process with.

### Culture Fit

The first chat is usually an introductory phone call where the hiring representative describes the position
and what they are looking for, answers any cultural questions like how they enjoy the
company, explains some perks of the job, and makes small talk to get a feel for your personality, etc.

Make sure to be ready to talk about:

* Your hobbies
* Technologies you are interested in
* What you are looking for
* Why you applied to X company
  * EVEN THOUGH you likely applied for the $$$, you better have a better reason
    * I use X product
    * I've read the company blog
    * Great reviews online, etc
* You'll be asked for some questions, have some ready
  * "How long have you been there?"
  * "How do you like it?"
  * "What do you most like about it?"

### Code Trivia

Sometimes you'll be asked seemingly random questions that you have either forgotten,
never thought about explaining, etc. This is a way for them to tell if you are actively
programming, have a passion for it, etc. Here are some good questions and answers
that you'll want to memorize and understand in case you are asked

### Take Home Test

A growing trend in interviews are take home tests. These a preferred way of interviewing
as you get to actually use your knowledge of technologies you'll be using on the job.
They are usually (but not always):

* Built with the technology being hired for (eg, a React app for a React Position).
* Given some sort of time requirement
  * Some are challenges that are done in 4 hours
  * Some give you a week or so, this gives you time to refresh or teach yourself a certain technology

Some downsides are:

* The open ended time requirements means you don't know how long other candidates spent on styling or features
  * Fix: have a go-to CSS framework you can use without slowing you down
* You are applying for a lot of jobs, take home assignments will build up
  * Fix: Don't put off any challenges in order to beef the current one up. Get a slimmed down project up fast if you have to
  * You can always mention how long you spent on it in the README, but remember your commit history has to line up!

Here are some take home tests samples that you can practice and take your time on:

1. Build a GitHub browser that lets you filter on username/organization, public repos, gists, and commits
   1. Here's an example https://kevincolten.com/redux-github-api/
2. Build Minesweeper

### White Boarding

White Boarding has a reputation for being the hardest part of an interview. You
have to stand in front of a white board and have to solve a problem while writing and talking
out loud. The coding language can usually be in "pseudocode", meaning just shorthand
for whatever code you are interested in. It doesn't have to pass without syntax errors, if
you don't remember a function or method name you just make it up (eg. `lowerCase(word)`), etc.
You can even go as far as just [write what you expect each line to do](https://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop2221/2221pseu.htm)

The reason white boarding is seen as difficult is there is really just a lack of
good practice problems. If you are dead set on getting a Job at Google, Facebook, etc
[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) is the "bible" to study
from. Don't be too imitidate, some candidates study for up to six months for these interviews. They
are not the ideal place to start for your first job

A more practical way to practice these problems are using online services like:

* [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

### Offer

If everything goes to plan, you'll enter the offer stage. It's easy to be intimdated into offering
the first thing they offer, and if it hits your threshold and it is your only offer, then go for it. But if it seems low, just remember:

1. If you are expecting an offer soon from somewhere else, you can ask for up to a week to "think it over" while you wait
2. You can, and possibly should, explain that you are weighing two or more offers
   * This can sometimes give you negotiating power
3. Hiring you has already been budgeted
   * The interview process has cost the company money and employee time
   * It is more cost effective to negotiate with you than to start over with another candidate from scratch
4. You are not directly competing with another candidate on time-to-accept nor salary
   * It is not a "race to the bottom" in salary

If you have two or more offers, treat them like buying a used car:

1. Go back and forth seeing if you can suggest the offer go a little higher do to another offer
2. A good go-to line is "This other offer is a little higher, but I REALLY WANT TO WORK HERE. So if you could match it, I can say yes right now."
3. You never have to divulge the other companies. So don't.
4. You don't have to explicitly say what the other offers are. So don't unless that's what you want from the company you want to work at.
   1. You will not get a higher offer than what you suggest, unless you can convice them (whether true or not) that you actually received a higher offer somewhere else.
