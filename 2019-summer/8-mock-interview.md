# Mock Interview Day

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone (including special guests!) will have **one minute** to answer the following prompt:

### Favorite technology

* What's your favorite programming language? Why?
**OR**
* What's your favorite web technology? Why?

## Mock Interviews

Our special guests from industry will help you practice both technical and non-technical interviews.

## Class discussion

### Course retrospective

* Share and celebrate achievements
* Job search next steps: Where will you go from here?
* Course feedback:
  * What did you hope to get out of this class that we didn't cover? (Or think future alumni could benefit from)
  * Is there anything we could have done differently?
  * What was something you enjoyed, or was helpful about this class?

**Thank you!**
