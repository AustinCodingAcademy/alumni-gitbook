# Onsite Interviews & Whiteboarding

## Guest speakers: ACA alumni panel

Guest speakers (and ACA alumni) Rachael Thompson, Cynthia Williams, and Lisa Umhey will speak about their job search experience, followed by a Q&A session.

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have **one minute** to answer the following prompt:

* What coding project are you most proud of?
  * What does the project do?
  * What was your role in the project?
  * Explain 1-2 features/aspects that make it your favorite project.
  
Congratulations! You just completed a one-minute pitch for your favorite project!

## Onsite interviews

### How to approach the interview

* Ensure that you spend time planning your approach but remember you can always go brute force and then optimize from there.

* Articulate/code up a working solution (even if it feels inefficient) and then iterate rather than immediately trying to jump to the clever solution, if you cannot explain your solution clearly in 5 minutes, it's probably too complex for the problem at hand.

* Make sure you are asking clarifying questions as you go along (there will not be tricks but you will need to ensure you have all the info you need).

* Practice talking through your coding out loud while you are doing it - the interviewers need to see where you are headed with your solutions and if you talk they can provide hints.

* Spend a little time thinking about how you would walk someone else through your past projects, what you did on them (as opposed to what your team did), and what you learned from them.

* Come prepared with questions for your interviewer - this is just as much a chance for you to ensure that this is the place you want to be.

* Make sure you use good test cases that will find edge/corner cases.

* You will need to debug your code.

* Remember the interviewer will ask for a quick intro, please be prepared to talk about your most recent technical work quickly but in detail so it doesn't eat into your coding time.

## Whiteboarding

Whiteboarding has a reputation for being the hardest part of the interview process. During whiteboarding interviews, the candidate stands in front of a white board and solves a coding problem while writing and talking out loud.

Why do employers include whiteboarding in the interview process?
Here are some goals of whiteboarding interviews:

* See how the candidate approaches tricky coding problems.
* Understand the candidate's thought process while solving problems.
* Test the candidate's communication skills. Can they communicate a technical solution to others? How do they communicate under pressure?
* Get a sense of what it's like to collaborate with the candidate on a technical problem.

Whiteboarding interview myths:

* You must correctly solve the coding question or they won't offer you a job.
  * FALSE. The goal of the interview is to see how you solve problems and communicate.

### Whiteboarding tips & tricks

* **Keep talking.** As with any type of interview, your goal should be to turn the whiteboarding session into as much of a conversation as possible. Explain everything you're thinking and writing on the board to the interviewer. Even if you're feeling unsure about something, say so: "I'm not 100% sure an array is the best solution for this, but I'm going to give it a try because..." A good interviewer will give you hints and guide you towards the solution.

* **Use pseudocode.** Don't get hung up on writing code with perfect syntax. The goal of the interview is to see how you think through problems, not to test your recollection of syntax rules. Use "pseudocode" - coding shorthand that explains what your solution is supposed to do. If you don't remember a function or method name, just make it up (eg. `lowerCase(word)`). You can even go as far as just [write what you expect each line to do](https://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop2221/2221pseu.htm).

* **Don't worry about creating a perfect solution on the first try.** 

* **The interviewer wants you to succeed.**
