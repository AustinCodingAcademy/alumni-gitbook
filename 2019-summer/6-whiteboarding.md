# Onsite Interviews & Whiteboarding

## Guest speakers: ACA alumni panel

Guest speakers (and ACA alumni) Rachael Thompson, Cynthia Williams, and Lisa Umhey will speak about their job search experience, followed by a Q&A session.

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have **one minute** to answer the following prompt:

* What coding project are you most proud of?
  * What does the project do?
  * What was your role in the project?
  * Explain 1-2 features/aspects that make it your favorite project.
  
Congratulations! You just completed a one-minute pitch for your favorite project!

## Onsite interviews

## Whiteboarding

Whiteboarding has a reputation for being the hardest part of the interview process. During whiteboarding interviews, the candidate stands in front of a white board and solves a coding problem while writing and talking out loud.

Why do employers include whiteboarding in the interview process?
Here are some goals of whiteboarding interviews:

* See how the candidate approaches tricky coding problems.
* Understand the candidate's thought process while solving problems.
* Test the candidate's communication skills. Can they communicate a technical solution to others? How do they communicate under pressure?
* Get a sense of what it's like to collaborate with the candidate on a technical problem.

Whiteboarding interview myths:

* You must correctly solve the coding question or they won't offer you a job.
  * FALSE. The goal of the interview is to see how you solve problems and communicate.

### Whiteboarding tips & tricks

* **Remember that the interviewer will ask for a quick intro.** Be prepared to give a technical summary of a favorite project, but keep it brief so it doesn't eat too much into your coding time. The interviewer may ask a few technical questions about your project and how it was implemented.

* **Don't worry about creating a perfect solution on the first try.** Articulate a working solution (even if it feels inefficient) and then iterate rather than immediately trying to jump to the clever solution. If you cannot explain your solution clearly in 5 minutes, it's probably too complex for the problem at hand.

* **Use pseudocode.** Don't get hung up on writing code with perfect syntax. The goal of the interview is to see how you think through problems, not to test your recollection of syntax rules. Use "pseudocode" - coding shorthand that explains what your solution is supposed to do. If you don't remember a function or method name, just make it up (eg. `lowerCase(word)`). You can even go as far as just [write what you expect each line to do](https://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop2221/2221pseu.htm).

* **Keep talking.** As with any type of interview, your goal should be to turn the whiteboarding session into as much of a conversation as possible. Explain everything you're thinking and writing on the board to the interviewer. Even if you're feeling unsure about something, say so: "I'm not 100% sure an array is the best solution for this, but I'm going to give it a try because..." A good interviewer will give you hints and guide you towards the solution.

* **Ask questions.** Make sure you are asking clarifying questions as you go along, to make sure you have the information you need to create a solution. The interviewer will often give you hints or indicate if you're headed in the right direction.

* **Test, test, test.** The interviewer will expect you to test and debug your code. Think about edge/corner cases. For example, what happens if the input is null?

* **The interviewer wants you to succeed.** If an employer has invited you onsite for a round of technical interviews, they've already invested a lot of energy on you and think you're a good fit for the role. Your interviewer's job is not to grill you, but to see how you'd interact and solve problems as a member of their team. This is also an opportunity to see if you enjoy working with them.

* **Come prepared with questions for your interviewer.** This is just as much a chance for you to ensure that the company is the place you want to be.
