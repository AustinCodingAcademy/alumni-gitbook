# Building Your Online Presence

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have **one minute** to answer the following prompt:

### Your coding origin story

* Introduce yourself:
  * Name
  * Which ACA track you just completed
* What inspired you to learn how to code?
* What brought you to ACA?

## Online presence - what’s the big deal?

### Exposure

Online presence is the easiest way to quickly plug into the local tech ecosystem.

Who sees your online profiles?
* Recruiters / headhunters
* Other HR folks
* Potential managers & co-workers
* Potential collaborators (open source projects, non-profits, hackathons)
* Influencers in the tech community
* Friends looking for jobs, introductions, connections

### Job applications

Recruiters and hiring managers rely heavily on your online presence to learn more about you. Having your online materials complete and up-to-date is **essential**. When a job opportunity comes your way, you'll be able to immediately begin the hiring process by directing the recruiter to your online profiles.

### Online presence checklist

Use the [ACA graduate profile page](https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/) as your guide. Your mission is to gather all the materials needed to complete your own ACA profile:

* Contact info - email, location, phone number (optional)
* Headshot
* Byline (a brief statement that describes your career objectives)
* LinkedIn profile
* Github account
* Work experience
* Education
* Portfolio project(s) - links to 1-3 hosted projects
* List of skills/technologies
* Personal website (optional)

**Important Reminder:** This process is iterative! Don't get hung up on making everything perfect. Focus on creating a high quality **first version** of everything on the Online Presence Checklist. You can always update and revise your materials throughout the job search process!

## Resume

Goal of your resume: Spark a conversation! What sets you apart?

### Resume sections

* Name
* Contact info
* Objective - role you’re seeking
* Work experience
* Education
* Projects
* Skills - a list of programming languages and technologies you know
* Volunteer experience (optional)
* Personal / hobbies / activities (optional)

Notice that much of this is similar to the info in your ACA graduate profile page. Complete your resume, and you'll be able to reuse much of the material for your profile page.

### Resume tips & tricks

* PDF format
* 1 page ideal, 2 pages max
* Skills section:
  * List skills in order of most comfortable to least.
  * If you list a language or technology, you **must** be able to respond briefly to the question, "Tell me a little about something you did with X..."
* Projects section:
  * What does the code you wrote do?
  * Why did you do it?
  * Include any quantifiable measurements you can.
* Hobbies/Activities section:
  * If you include Hobbies/Activities, keep it short!
  * As an inteviewer, I'm a fan of this section. It helps me get the conversation started, calm any nerves, and get a beter sense of the candidate as a whole person.

## LinkedIn

### LinkedIn tips & tricks

* "Prettify" your LinkedIn profile url with your full name: https://www.linkedin.com/in/danawen
* Headshots:
  * You don't need a professional photographer! My headshot photos were taken by a childhood friend and my dad.
  * **Class portrait session!** If you need to update your headshot, I will take your photo before/after the next class.

### Sample LinkedIn profiles

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevincolten

## Github

### Sample Github pages

* https://github.com/kevincolten

## Project portfolio

As an entry-level developer, your portfolio is the main place potential employers will go to get a sense of what you can do.

Select **1-3 current or recent coding projects** to highlight in your portfolio. These will appear on your ACA graduate profile page. You can also  include them on your LinkedIn page and personal website.

### Project checklist

* Have a hosted demo if it is a web app
* Be styled with a CSS Framework
* Have a descriptive README.md in the repo
* Code must be linted
* Code should be documented and commented
* Hosted Project and master branch should have only complete features

## Personal website

This is **optional**. Potential employers should be able to find everything they need to know on your resume, LinkedIn page, and Github account.

### Website tips & tricks

* Unless you're applying to design jobs, keep it simple! Bare bones is best.

### Sample websites

* https://kevincolten.com
* https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/

## Miscellaneous tips & tricks

* If possible, use a common username across all your online profiles. Try to snag your name (if's that's not available, aim for a professional-sounding handle). This helps create a consistent online brand. For example:
  * https://kevincolten.github.io
  * https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/kevin-colten
  * https://kevincolten.com
  * https://kevincolten.com/KevinColten.pdf
  * https://github.com/kevincolten
  * https://linkedin.com/in/kevincolten
  * https://en.gravatar.com/kevincolten
* [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/): An avatar image that follows you from site to site appearing beside your name when you do things like comment or post on a blog.
* Any tips & tricks you'd like to share?

## Class discussion

### Your feelings about the job search process

* What are you excited about?
