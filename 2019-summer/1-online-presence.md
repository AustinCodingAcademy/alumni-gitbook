# Building Your Online Presence

## Question of the day

During the Scrum Meeting, we'll go around the circle and everyone will have **one minute** to answer the following prompt:

### Your coding origin story

* Introduce yourself:
  * Name
  * Which ACA track you just completed
* What inspired you to learn how to code?
* What brought you to ACA?

## Online presence - whatâ€™s the big deal?

### Exposure

Online presence is the easiest way to quickly plug into the local tech ecosystem.

Who sees your online profiles?
* Recruiters / headhunters
* Other HR folks
* Potential managers & co-workers
* Potential collaborators (open source projects, non-profits, hackathons)
* Influencers in the tech community
* Friends looking for jobs, introductions, connections

### Job applications

Recruiters and hiring managers rely heavily on your online presence to learn more about you. Having your online materials complete and up-to-date is **essential**. When a job opportunity comes your way, you'll be able to immediately begin the hiring process by directing the recruiter to your online profiles.
