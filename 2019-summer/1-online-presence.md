# Building Your Online Presence

## Online presence - what’s the big deal?

### Exposure

Online presence is the easiest way to quickly plug into the local tech ecosystem.

Who sees your online profiles?
* Recruiters / headhunters
* Other HR folks
* Potential managers & co-workers
* Potential collaborators (open source projects, non-profits, hackathons)
* Influencers in the tech community
* Friends looking for jobs, introductions, connections

### Job applications

Recruiters and hiring managers rely heavily on your online presence to learn more about you. Having your online materials complete and up-to-date is **essential**. When a job opportunity comes your way, you'll be able to immediately begin the hiring process by directing the recruiter to your online profiles.

### Online presence checklist

Use the [ACA graduate profile page](https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/) as your guide. Your mission is to gather all the materials needed to complete your own ACA profile:

* Contact info - email, location, phone number (optional)
* Headshot
* Byline (a brief statement that describes your career objectives)
* LinkedIn profile
* Github account
* Work experience
* Education
* Portfolio project(s) - links to 1-3 hosted projects
* List of skills/technologies
* Personal website (optional)

**Important Reminder:** This process is iterative! Don't get hung up on making everything perfect. Focus on creating a high quality **first version** of everything on the Online Presence Checklist. You can always update and revise your materials throughout the job search process!

## Resume

Goal of your resume: Spark a conversation! What sets you apart?

### Resume sections

* Name
* Contact info
* Objective - role you’re seeking
* Work experience
* Education
* Projects
* Skills - a list of programming languages and technologies you know
* Volunteer experience (optional)
* Personal / hobbies / activities (optional)

Notice that much of this is similar to the info in your ACA graduate profile page. Complete your resume, and you'll be able to reuse much of the material for your profile page.

### Resume template and examples

* [Resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxS7owJNMEZIpGpQ9QDICJxVcyg8v9qW5c_avr6FC6g/edit) for ACA grads

* [Lisa Umhey resume](Resume_LisaUmhey.pdf)

### Resume tips & tricks

* PDF format
* 1 page ideal, 2 pages max
* Tailor your resume to the role you're applying for
* Skills section:
  * List skills in order of most comfortable to least.
  * If you list a language or technology, you **must** be able to respond briefly to the question, "Tell me a little about something you did with X..."
* Projects section:
  * What does the code you wrote do?
  * Why did you do it?
  * Include any quantifiable measurements you can.
* Hobbies/Activities section:
  * If you include Hobbies/Activities, keep it short!
  * As an inteviewer, I'm a fan of this section. It helps me get the conversation started, calm any nerves, and get a beter sense of the candidate as a whole person.
  * [CV Compiler](https://cvcompiler.com/) - online tool that automatically tests/scans your resume and suggests improvements

## LinkedIn

### LinkedIn tips & tricks

* "Prettify" your LinkedIn profile url with your full name: https://www.linkedin.com/in/danawen
* Headshot photos:
  * You don't need a professional photographer! My headshot photos were taken by a childhood friend and my dad.
  * **Class portrait session!** If you need to update your headshot, I will take your photo before/after class on Thursday 7/18.

### Sample LinkedIn profiles

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-umhey - ACA graduate
* https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cumming/
* https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevincolten
* [ACA graduate profile page](https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/) - click on the "in" icons to view LinkedIn profiles

## Project portfolio

As an entry-level developer, your portfolio is the main place potential employers will go to get a sense of what you can do.

Select **1-3 current or recent coding projects** to highlight in your portfolio. These will appear on your ACA graduate profile page. You can also include them on your LinkedIn page and personal website.

### Project checklist

* Have a hosted demo if it is a web app
* Be styled with a CSS Framework
* Have a descriptive README.md in the repo
* Code must be linted
* Code should be documented and commented
* Hosted Project and master branch should have only complete features

## Github

Prospective employers will look at your Github profile page to get a sense of your coding activity. If you direct an employer to any of your code on Github, you can bet they will look at it! Repos for your portfolio projects should be organized and contain clear README files.

**All** of your recent code should be on your Github account. If you've been working on a coding project that's not on Github or under version control, make a Github repo and get it checked in ASAP. Otherwise it will not be seen by potential employers. Show off your code!

Your Github profile is also a good place to showcase any contributions to open source or volunteer projects.

### Sample Github pages

* https://github.com/kevincolten
* https://github.com/danawen
* [ACA graduate profile page](https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/) - click on the Octocat icons to view Github profiles

## Personal website

This is **optional**. Potential employers should be able to find everything they need to know on your resume, LinkedIn page, and Github account.

Unless you're applying to design jobs, keep your personal website simple! Bare bones is best.

Personal website resources:
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - website hosting
* [WebFaction](https://www.webfaction.com/) - website hosting

### Sample websites

* https://kevincolten.com

## Miscellaneous tips & tricks

* If possible, use a common username across all your online profiles. Try to snag your name (if's that's not available, aim for a professional-sounding handle). This helps create a consistent online brand. For example:
  * https://kevincolten.github.io
  * https://austincodingacademy.com/hire/kevin-colten
  * https://kevincolten.com
  * https://kevincolten.com/KevinColten.pdf
  * https://github.com/kevincolten
  * https://linkedin.com/in/kevincolten
  * https://en.gravatar.com/kevincolten

* [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/): An avatar image that follows you from site to site appearing beside your name when you do things like comment or post on a blog.
* Any tips & tricks you'd like to share?

## Class discussion

**Today's topic:** Your feelings about the job search process

* What are you excited about?
* What are you anxious about?
* What topics do you want to know more about?
* What do you want to get out of this class?

## Homework

* Complete a PDF version of your resume.
* Host your PDF resume on your Github account with GitHub Pages. If you're new to GitHub Pages, follow the steps below:
  * In your GitHub account, create a new repository called `resume`.
  * On the new repository page, look in the blue "Quick setup" box. Click "uploading an existing file".
  * Upload your resume PDF file.
  * On the home page of your repository, click Settings. Scroll down to the section "GitHub Pages".
  * In the "Source" dropdown, select the "Master branch" option. This will enable GitHub Pages for this repository.
  * In the "GitHub Pages" section, you should now see a public URL for your resume repository. Example: `https://<your-username>.github.io/resume/`
  * To access your resume file, visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/resume/<resume-file-name.pdf>`
